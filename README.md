# Geometry-Dash-GBA
A buggy game of geometry dash on the Game Boy Advance

This project is my first attempt at making something on the GBA that uses tiles and sprites and such. Many headaches were suffered during the making of this project :)

## Setting up environment

Follow [these instructions](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman) to get DKP set up

Install ```gba-dev``` by running ```sudo dkp-pacman -S gba-dev```

## Running

Then, just ```make``` in the master directory, and run the game with your favorite GBA emulator!

Here's a gif of it running on original hardware:
